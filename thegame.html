        <h2>About Srephot Bahalal</h2>
        <p>The space station "Srephot Bahalal" uses a moving hallway system to facilitate transportation inside the station. This allows crew members to move effortlessly without needing to walk or use other means.</p>
        <p>To deal with the absence of gravity, the station uses suitable conditioning (hot or cold), which helps maintain a comfortable environment for the crew.</p>
        <p>Communication is handled through an internal network that allows seamless interaction between crew members across the station.</p>
        <p>Research conducted on the station focuses on understanding the impacts of outer space on fire spread, which is crucial for future space exploration and safety measures.</p>
        <p>The crew communicates with Earth using a special system that connects them directly to the ground team for real-time updates and assistance.</p>
        <p>Oxygen and compression systems ensure proper air pressure and breathable air inside the station, making it a habitable environment.</p>
        <p>Food is handled by a combination of supplies brought every two months and on-board cultivation of fruits and vegetables.</p>
        <p>Crew members sleep in comfortable beds equipped with special straps to counteract the lack of gravity and ensure a restful experience.</p>
        <p>The station's safety is ensured by its ventilation system, UV-protective walls, and carefully managed food supplies, making it a secure living space.</p>
        <p>People reach the station via electric rockets supported by a chemical engine, making transportation efficient and reliable.</p>
        <p>The station is shaped like a ring, with dorms surrounding the central research room, and it runs on energy harnessed from solar panels.</p>
